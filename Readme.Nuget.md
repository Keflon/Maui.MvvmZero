# FunctionZero.Maui.MvvmZero

## Latest update
Version 8+ are built for NET 8.

This is an evolution of [MvvmZero for Xamarin](https://github.com/Keflon/FunctionZero.MvvmZero)  

## Ethos
`MvvmZero` is there to guide the way, not get in the way.  
If you understand the MVVM pattern, the aim is for MvvmZero to be intuitive, and to remain so if 
you go off the beaten track to do things your own way.

## Quickstart, Samples and Documentation
Take a look at the [source repository](https://github.com/Keflon/Maui.MvvmZero) for a quickstart 
and to watch while the samples and documentation are improved over time.  

## Complimentary libraries included in MvvmZero
[Maui.zBind](https://github.com/Keflon/FunctionZero.Maui.zBind) to evaluate logic against your 
ViewModel directly from your xaml binding! Never have to write a `BindingConverter` again.  

[CommandZero](https://github.com/Keflon/FunctionZero.CommandZero) to stop worrying about wiring 
up `CanExecuteChanged` or having to manually disable other Commands whilst a long-running 
Command is busy!   

[Maui.Controls](https://github.com/Keflon/FunctionZero.Maui.Controls) for a TreeView, ListView 
with TwoWay bindable ScrollOffset, MaskView, Expander, and workarounds for bugs in `FlyoutPage` and `TabbedPage`.

These are standalone libraries that can save you time and effort whether you use MvvmZero or not.

## Help improve Maui.MvvmZero
Most of my open-source starts out to fill a need in *my* production environment. This means 
I add features as I need them and I fix bugs as I encounter them. Your use-case will be different, 
so if you see room for improvement, please let me know and I'll see what I can do.

If you want to help:
- If you find any bugs please open a ticket.
- If you have a feature request you can let me know.
- If you use this, or any [other of my libraries](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/FunctionZero) 
please tell your friends, star the repo, or even consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/Keflon).
